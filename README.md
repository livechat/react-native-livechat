### ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️

This project is no longer maintained. In order to implement the LiveChat Chat Widget inside your React Native application, please use Webview to embed the web Chat Widget using a direct chat link.

To do it, use the `react-native-webview` library and add a `Webview` component as shown below. Remember to replace the `<LICENSE_ID>` string with your LiveChat's license id.

```javascript
<WebView
  source={{
    uri: 'https://secure.livechatinc.com/customer/action/open_chat?license_id=<LICENSE_ID>',
  }}
/>
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use LiveChat in your React application, you will need the LiveChat license ID.

To obtain authorization data (redirect_uri and client_id), you need to create a new LiveChat app. See our [Creating LiveChat apps](https://developers.livechatinc.com/docs/getting-started/guides/#creating-livechat-apps) documentation.

- `client_id` - identifies the application, you will receive it after creating a new application in [Developer Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps)
- `redirect_uri` - it must be one of the URLs that you entered when creating the new app in the [Developer Console](https://developers.livechatinc.com/console/apps)

## User Guide

### Start

Having imported LiveChat for React Native, put it in your render method:

```javascript
import LiveChat from 'react-native-livechat'

...

<LiveChat license="<LICENSE_ID>" redirectUri="https://example.org" clientId="<APP_CLIENT_ID>" />
```

You can also pass 'group' as a prop, to assign chat to chosen LiveChat group.

```javascript
<LiveChat
  group={2}
  license="<LICENSE_ID>"
  redirectUri="https://example.org"
  clientId="<APP_CLIENT_ID>"
  region="dal" // optional, dal is the default
/>
```

### Customization

#### Chat bubble

The chat bubble is the round icon (chat trigger) in the bottom right corner of the screen.

##### Position

You can control the position of the bubble with `bubbleStyles` prop:

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  bubbleStyles: {
    position: 'absolute',
    left: 24,
    bottom: 24,
  },
})

;<LiveChat
  license="<LICENSE_ID>"
  redirectUri="https://example.org"
  clientId="<APP_CLIENT_ID>"
  bubbleStyles={styles.bubbleStyles}
/>
```

##### Color

You can change the color of the bubble by passing `bubbleColor` prop:

```javascript
<LiveChat
  bubbleColor="red"
  license="<LICENSE_ID>"
  redirectUri="https://example.org"
  clientId="<APP_CLIENT_ID>"
/>
```

##### Custom bubble

If you don't like the default bubble, you can send `bubble` prop with your own component:

```javascript
<LiveChat
  license="<LICENSE_ID>"
  redirectUri="https://example.org"
  clientId="<APP_CLIENT_ID>"
  bubble={<View style={{ width: 60, height: 60, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />}
/>
```

#### Chat widget

This module uses [react-native-gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) for chat UI.

You can customise your chat widget by sending props to LiveChat component (like you would normally do with GiftedChat component).

For example, if you want `onPressAvatar` to show agent's details, you can do it like this:

```javascript
<LiveChat license="<LICENSE_ID>" onPressAvatar={(info) => console.warn(info)} />
```

You can find all props in the official [react-native-gifted-chat documentation](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat).
