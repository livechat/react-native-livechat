It works for both iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use LiveChat in your React application, you will need LiveChat license ID. 

If you already have a LiveChat account, get your **license_id** [here](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/code).

If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://www.livechatinc.com/).

### Installation

To import LiveChat for React Native, run the following command:

```javascript
npm install react-native-livechat --save
```

## User Guide

### Start

Having imported LiveChat for React Native, put it in your render method:

```javascript
import LiveChat from 'react-native-livechat'

...

<LiveChat license="your_license_id" />
```

You can also pass 'group' as a prop, to assign chat to chosen LiveChat group.
```javascript
<LiveChat group={2} license="your_license_id" />
```


### Customization

#### Chat bubble

Chat bubble is the round icon (chat trigger) in the bottom right corner of the screen.

##### Position

You can control the position of the bubble with `bubbleLeft` and `bubbleTop` props:

```javascript
<LiveChat bubbleLeft={0} bubbleTop={0} license="your_license_id" />
```

##### Draggability

By default, the bubble component is draggable and movable. You can disable this option by sending `movable` prop with `false` value:

*Example:*
```javascript
<LiveChat movable={false} license="your_license_id" />
```

##### Color

You can change the color of the bubble by passing `bubbleColor` prop:

```javascript
<LiveChat bubbleColor='red' license="your_license_id" />
```
##### Custom bubble

If you don't like the default bubble, you can send `bubble` prop with your own component:

```javascript
<LiveChat license="your_license_id"
  bubble={
  <View style={{ width: 60, height: 60, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />
  }
/>
```

#### Chat window

This module uses [react-native-gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) for chat UI.

You can customise your chat widget by sending props to LiveChat component (like you would normally do with GiftedChat component).

For example, if you want `onPressAvatar` to show agent's details, you can do it like this:

```javascript
<LiveChat license="your_license_id"
  onPressAvatar={ info => console.warn(info) } />
```

You can find all props in the official [react-native-gifted-chat documentation](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat).


### Methods

This module uses [LiveChat Customer SDK](https://docs.livechatinc.com/visitor-sdk/). All methods are described [here](https://docs.livechatinc.com/visitor-sdk/#methods).

To use LiveChat Visitor SDK method, you have to create LiveChat reference:

```javascript
<LiveChat onLoaded={ ref => this.livechat = ref } 
	license="your_license_id"/>
```

Let's say you want to close the current chat. You can do it in two ways:
```javascript
 this.livechat.closeChat();
 // is the same as:
 GLOBAL.visitorSDK.closeChat();
```
